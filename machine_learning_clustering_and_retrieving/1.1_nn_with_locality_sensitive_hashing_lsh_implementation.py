Many matrix operations available for NumPy arrays are also available for SciPy sparse matrices.

# ## Train an LSH model

# LSH performs an efficient neighbor search by randomly partitioning all reference data points into different bins. Today we will build a popular variant of LSH known as random binary projection, which approximates cosine distance. There are other variants we could use for other choices of distance metrics.
# 
# The first step is to generate a collection of random vectors from the standard Gaussian distribution.

# In[73]:

def generate_random_vectors(num_vector, dim):
    return np.random.randn(dim, num_vector)


# To visualize these Gaussian random vectors, let's look at an example in low-dimensions.  Below, we generate 3 random vectors each of dimension 5.

# In[74]:

# Generate 3 random vectors of dimension 5, arranged into a single 5 x 3 matrix.
np.random.seed(0) # set seed=0 for consistent results
generate_random_vectors(num_vector=3, dim=5)


# We now generate random vectors of the same dimensionality as our vocubulary size (547979).  Each vector can be used to compute one bit in the bin encoding.  We generate 16 vectors, leading to a 16-bit encoding of the bin index for each document.

# In[75]:

# Generate 16 random vectors of dimension 547979
np.random.seed(0)
random_vectors = generate_random_vectors(num_vector=16, dim=547979)
random_vectors.shape


# Next, we partition data points into bins. Instead of using explicit loops, we'd like to utilize matrix operations for greater efficiency. Let's walk through the construction step by step.
# 
# We'd like to decide which bin document 0 should go. Since 16 random vectors were generated in the previous cell, we have 16 bits to represent the bin index. The first bit is given by the sign of the dot product between the first random vector and the document's TF-IDF vector.

# In[77]:

doc = corpus[0, :] # vector of tf-idf values for document 0
doc.dot(random_vectors[:, 0]) >= 0 # True if positive sign; False if negative sign

#DAF
print doc
print len(random_vectors[:, 0])
print doc.dot(random_vectors[:, 0]) >= 0


# Similarly, the second bit is computed as the sign of the dot product between the second random vector and the document vector.

# In[78]:

doc.dot(random_vectors[:, 1]) >= 0 # True if positive sign; False if negative sign


# We can compute all of the bin index bits at once as follows. Note the absence of the explicit `for` loop over the 16 vectors. Matrix operations let us batch dot-product computation in a highly efficent manner, unlike the `for` loop construction. Given the relative inefficiency of loops in Python, the advantage of matrix operations is even greater.

# In[79]:

doc.dot(random_vectors) >= 0 # should return an array of 16 True/False bits


# In[80]:

np.array(doc.dot(random_vectors) >= 0, dtype=int) # display index bits in 0/1's


# All documents that obtain exactly this vector will be assigned to the same bin. We'd like to repeat the identical operation on all documents in the Wikipedia dataset and compute the corresponding bin indices. Again, we use matrix operations  so that no explicit loop is needed.

# In[81]:

corpus[0:2].dot(random_vectors) >= 0 # compute bit indices of first two documents


# In[82]:

corpus.dot(random_vectors) >= 0 # compute bit indices of ALL documents


# We're almost done! To make it convenient to refer to individual bins, we convert each binary bin index into a single integer: 
# ```
# Bin index                      integer
# [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]   => 0
# [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]   => 1
# [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]   => 2
# [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]   => 3
# ...
# [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]   => 65532
# [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1]   => 65533
# [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]   => 65534
# [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]   => 65535 (= 2^16-1)
# ```
# By the [rules of binary number representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Decimal), we just need to compute the dot product between the document vector and the vector consisting of powers of 2:

# In[83]:

doc = corpus[0, :]  # first document
index_bits = (doc.dot(random_vectors) >= 0)
powers_of_two = (1 << np.arange(15, -1, -1))
print index_bits
print powers_of_two
print index_bits.dot(powers_of_two)


# Since it's the dot product again, we batch it with a matrix operation:

# In[84]:

index_bits = corpus.dot(random_vectors) >= 0
index_bits.dot(powers_of_two)


# This array gives us the integer index of the bins for all documents.
# 
# Now we are ready to complete the following function. Given the integer bin indices for the documents, you should compile a list of document IDs that belong to each bin. Since a list is to be maintained for each unique bin index, a dictionary of lists is used.
# 
# 1. Compute the integer bin indices. This step is already completed.
# 2. For each document in the dataset, do the following:
#    * Get the integer bin index for the document.
#    * Fetch the list of document ids associated with the bin; if no list yet exists for this bin, assign the bin an empty list.
#    * Add the document id to the end of the list.

# **Moral of the story**. Similar data points will in general _tend to_ fall into _nearby_ bins, but that's all we can say about LSH. In a high-dimensional space such as text features, we often get unlucky with our selection of only a few random vectors such that dissimilar data points go into the same bin while similar data points fall into different bins. **Given a query document, we must consider all documents in the nearby bins and sort them according to their actual distances from the query.**

# ## Query the LSH model

# Let us first implement the logic for searching nearby neighbors, which goes like this:
# ```
# 1. Let L be the bit representation of the bin that contains the query documents.
# 2. Consider all documents in bin L.
# 3. Consider documents in the bins whose bit representation differs from L by 1 bit.
# 4. Consider documents in the bins whose bit representation differs from L by 2 bits.
# ...
# ```

# To obtain candidate bins that differ from the query bin by some number of bits, we use `itertools.combinations`, which produces all possible subsets of a given list. See [this documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations) for details.
# ```
# 1. Decide on the search radius r. This will determine the number of different bits between the two vectors.
# 2. For each subset (n_1, n_2, ..., n_r) of the list [0, 1, 2, ..., num_vector-1], do the following:
#    * Flip the bits (n_1, n_2, ..., n_r) of the query bin to produce a new bit vector.
#    * Fetch the list of documents belonging to the bin indexed by the new bit vector.
#    * Add those documents to the candidate set.
# ```
# 
# Each line of output from the following cell is a 3-tuple indicating where the candidate bin would differ from the query bin. For instance,
# ```
# (0, 1, 3)
# ```
# indicates that the candiate bin differs from the query bin in first, second, and fourth bits.

# ## Effect of nearby bin search

# How does nearby bin search affect the outcome of LSH? There are three variables that are affected by the search radius:
# * Number of candidate documents considered
# * Query time
# * Distance of approximate neighbors from the query

# Let us run LSH multiple times, each with different radii for nearby bin search. We will measure the three variables as discussed above.

# Some observations:
# * As we increase the search radius, we find more neighbors that are a smaller distance away.
# * With increased search radius comes a greater number documents that have to be searched. Query time is higher as a consequence.
# * With sufficiently high search radius, the results of LSH begin to resemble the results of brute-force search.

# **Quiz Question**. What was the smallest search radius that yielded the correct nearest neighbor, namely Joe Biden?
# 
# 
# **Quiz Question**. Suppose our goal was to produce 10 approximate nearest neighbors whose average distance from the query document is within 0.01 of the average for the true 10 nearest neighbors. For Barack Obama, the true 10 nearest neighbors are on average about 0.77. What was the smallest search radius for Barack Obama that produced an average distance of 0.78 or better?

# ## Quality metrics for neighbors

# The above analysis is limited by the fact that it was run with a single query, namely Barack Obama. We should repeat the analysis for the entirety of data. Iterating over all documents would take a long time, so let us randomly choose 10 documents for our analysis.
# 
# For each document, we first compute the true 25 nearest neighbors, and then run LSH multiple times. We look at two metrics:
# 
# * Precision@10: How many of the 10 neighbors given by LSH are among the true 25 nearest neighbors?
# * Average cosine distance of the neighbors from the query
# 
# Then we run LSH multiple times with different search radii.

# We see a similar trade-off between quality and performance: as the number of random vectors increases, the query time goes down as each bin contains fewer documents on average, but on average the neighbors are likewise placed farther from the query. On the other hand, when using a small enough number of random vectors, LSH becomes very similar brute-force search: Many documents appear in a single bin, so searching the query bin alone covers a lot of the corpus; then, including neighboring bins might result in searching all documents, just as in the brute-force approach.
