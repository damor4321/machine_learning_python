# # k-means with text data

# In this assignment you will
# * Cluster Wikipedia documents using k-means
# * Explore the role of random initialization on the quality of the clustering
# * Explore how results differ after changing the number of clusters
# * Evaluate clustering, both quantitatively and qualitatively
#

# ## Load data, extract features

# To work with text data, we must first convert the documents into numerical features. As in the first assignment, let's extract TF-IDF features for each article.

# For the remainder of the assignment, we will use sparse matrices. Sparse matrices are matrices that have a small number of nonzero entries. A good data structure for sparse matrices would only store the nonzero entries to save space and speed up computation. SciPy provides a highly-optimized library for sparse matrices. Many matrix operations available for NumPy arrays are also available for SciPy sparse matrices.
# 
# We first convert the TF-IDF column (in dictionary format) into the SciPy sparse matrix format. We included plenty of comments for the curious; if you'd like, you may skip the next block and treat the function as a black box.

# ## Normalize all vectors

# As discussed in the previous assignment, Euclidean distance can be a poor metric of similarity between documents, as it unfairly penalizes long articles. For a reasonable assessment of similarity, we should disregard the length information and use length-agnostic metrics, such as cosine distance.
# 
# The k-means algorithm does not directly work with cosine distance, so we take an alternative route to remove length information: we normalize all vectors to be unit length. It turns out that Euclidean distance closely mimics cosine distance when all vectors are unit length. In particular, the squared Euclidean distance between any two vectors of length one is directly proportional to their cosine distance.
# 
# We can prove this as follows. Let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ be normalized vectors, i.e. unit vectors, so that $\|\mathbf{x}\|=\|\mathbf{y}\|=1$. Write the squared Euclidean distance as the dot product of $(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y})$ to itself:
# \begin{align*}
# \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|^2 &= (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y})^T(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y})\\
#                               &= (\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x}) - 2(\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y}) + (\mathbf{y}^T \mathbf{y})\\
#                               &= \|\mathbf{x}\|^2 - 2(\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y}) + \|\mathbf{y}\|^2\\
#                               &= 2 - 2(\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y})\\
#                               &= 2(1 - (\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y}))\\
#                               &= 2\left(1 - \frac{\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\|\|\mathbf{y}\|}\right)\\
#                               &= 2\left[\text{cosine distance}\right]
# \end{align*}
# 
# This tells us that two **unit vectors** that are close in Euclidean distance are also close in cosine distance. Thus, the k-means algorithm (which naturally uses Euclidean distances) on normalized vectors will produce the same results as clustering using cosine distance as a distance metric.
# 
# We import the [`normalize()` function](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.normalize.html) from scikit-learn to normalize all vectors to unit length.

from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize
tf_idf = normalize(tf_idf)

# ## Implement k-means

# Let us implement the k-means algorithm. First, we choose an initial set of centroids. A common practice is to choose randomly from the data points.
# 
# **Note:** We specify a seed here, so that everyone gets the same answer. In practice, we highly recommend to use different seeds every time (for instance, by using the current timestamp).

# In[12]:

def get_initial_centroids(data, k, seed=None):
    '''Randomly choose k data points as initial centroids'''
    if seed is not None: # useful for obtaining consistent results
        np.random.seed(seed)
    n = data.shape[0] # number of data points
        
    # Pick K indices from range [0, N).
    rand_indices = np.random.randint(0, n, k)
    
    # Keep centroids as dense format, as many entries will be nonzero due to averaging.
    # As long as at least one document in a cluster contains a word,
    # it will carry a nonzero weight in the TF-IDF vector of the centroid.
    centroids = data[rand_indices,:].toarray()
    
    return centroids


# After initialization, the k-means algorithm iterates between the following two steps:
# 1. Assign each data point to the closest centroid.
# $$
# z_i \gets \mathrm{argmin}_j \|\mu_j - \mathbf{x}_i\|^2
# $$
# 2. Revise centroids as the mean of the assigned data points.
# $$
# \mu_j \gets \frac{1}{n_j}\sum_{i:z_i=j} \mathbf{x}_i
# $$

# In pseudocode, we iteratively do the following:
# ```
# cluster_assignment = assign_clusters(data, centroids)
# centroids = revise_centroids(data, k, cluster_assignment)
# ```

# ### Assigning clusters

# How do we implement Step 1 of the main k-means loop above? First import `pairwise_distances` function from scikit-learn, which calculates Euclidean distances between rows of given arrays. See [this documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances.html) for more information.
# 
# For the sake of demonstration, let's look at documents 100 through 102 as query documents and compute the distances between each of these documents and every other document in the corpus. In the k-means algorithm, we will have to compute pairwise distances between the set of centroids and the set of documents.

# In[13]:

from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

# Get the TF-IDF vectors for documents 100 through 102.
queries = tf_idf[100:102,:]

# Compute pairwise distances from every data point to each query vector.
dist = pairwise_distances(tf_idf, queries, metric='euclidean')

#DAF understanding
print dist
print dist.shape


# More formally, `dist[i,j]` is assigned the distance between the `i`th row of `X` (i.e., `X[i,:]`) and the `j`th row of `Y` (i.e., `Y[j,:]`).

# **Checkpoint:** For a moment, suppose that we initialize three centroids with the first 3 rows of `tf_idf`. Write code to compute distances from each of the centroids to all data points in `tf_idf`. Then find the distance between row 430 of `tf_idf` and the second centroid and save it to `dist`.

# In[14]:

# Students should write code here
distances = pairwise_distances(tf_idf, tf_idf[0:3,:], metric='euclidean')
print distances.shape

dist = distances[430,1]
print dist


# In[15]:

'''Test cell'''
if np.allclose(dist, pairwise_distances(tf_idf[430,:], tf_idf[1,:])):
    print('Pass')
else:
    print('Check your code again')


# **Checkpoint:** Next, given the pairwise distances, we take the minimum of the distances for each data point. Fittingly, NumPy provides an `argmin` function. See [this documentation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.argmin.html) for details.
# 
# Read the documentation and write code to produce a 1D array whose i-th entry indicates the centroid that is the closest to the i-th data point. Use the list of distances from the previous checkpoint and save them as `distances`. The value 0 indicates closeness to the first centroid, 1 indicates closeness to the second centroid, and so forth. Save this array as `closest_cluster`.
# 
# **Hint:** the resulting array should be as long as the number of data points.

# In[16]:

# Students should write code here
closest_cluster = np.argmin(distances, axis=1)
print closest_cluster.shape


# In[17]:

'''Test cell'''
reference = [list(row).index(min(row)) for row in distances]
if np.allclose(closest_cluster, reference):
    print('Pass')
else:
    print('Check your code again')


# **Checkpoint:** Let's put these steps together.  First, initialize three centroids with the first 3 rows of `tf_idf`. Then, compute distances from each of the centroids to all data points in `tf_idf`. Finally, use these distance calculations to compute cluster assignments and assign them to `cluster_assignment`.

# In[18]:

# Students should write code here
centroids = tf_idf[0:3,:]
distances = pairwise_distances(tf_idf, centroids, metric='euclidean')
cluster_assignment = np.argmin(distances, axis=1)

#DAF understanding
print centroids.shape
print distances.shape
print cluster_assignment.shape

#cluster_assignment = assign_clusters(data, centroids)


# In[19]:

if len(cluster_assignment)==59071 and    np.array_equal(np.bincount(cluster_assignment), np.array([23061, 10086, 25924])):
    print('Pass') # count number of data points for each cluster
else:
    print('Check your code again.')


# Now we are ready to fill in the blanks in this function:

# In[20]:

def assign_clusters(data, centroids):
    
    # Compute distances between each data point and the set of centroids:
    # Fill in the blank (RHS only)
    distances_from_centroids = pairwise_distances(data, centroids, metric='euclidean')
    
    # Compute cluster assignments for each data point:
    # Fill in the blank (RHS only)
    cluster_assignment = np.argmin(distances_from_centroids, axis=1)
    
    return cluster_assignment


# **Checkpoint**. For the last time, let us check if Step 1 was implemented correctly. With rows 0, 2, 4, and 6 of `tf_idf` as an initial set of centroids, we assign cluster labels to rows 0, 10, 20, ..., and 90 of `tf_idf`. The resulting cluster labels should be `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1]`.

# In[21]:

if np.allclose(assign_clusters(tf_idf[0:100:10], tf_idf[0:8:2]), np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1])):
    print('Pass')
else:
    print('Check your code again.')


# ### Revising clusters

# Let's turn to Step 2, where we compute the new centroids given the cluster assignments. 

# SciPy and NumPy arrays allow for filtering via Boolean masks. For instance, we filter all data points that are assigned to cluster 0 by writing
# ```
# data[cluster_assignment==0,:]
# ```

# To develop intuition about filtering, let's look at a toy example consisting of 3 data points and 2 clusters.

# In[22]:

data = np.array([[1., 2., 0.],
                 [0., 0., 0.],
                 [2., 2., 0.]])
centroids = np.array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.],
                      [0., -0.5, 0.]])


# Let's assign these data points to the closest centroid.

# In[23]:

cluster_assignment = assign_clusters(data, centroids)
print cluster_assignment


# The expression `cluster_assignment==1` gives a list of Booleans that says whether each data point is assigned to cluster 1 or not:

# In[24]:

cluster_assignment==1


# Likewise for cluster 0:

# In[25]:

cluster_assignment==0


# In lieu of indices, we can put in the list of Booleans to pick and choose rows. Only the rows that correspond to a `True` entry will be retained.
# 
# First, let's look at the data points (i.e., their values) assigned to cluster 1:

# In[26]:

data[cluster_assignment==1]


# This makes sense since [0 0 0] is closer to [0 -0.5 0] than to [0.5 0.5 0].
# 
# Now let's look at the data points assigned to cluster 0:

# In[27]:

data[cluster_assignment==0]


# Again, this makes sense since these values are each closer to [0.5 0.5 0] than to [0 -0.5 0].
# 
# Given all the data points in a cluster, it only remains to compute the mean. Use [np.mean()](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html). By default, the function averages all elements in a 2D array. To compute row-wise or column-wise means, add the `axis` argument. See the linked documentation for details. 
# 
# Use this function to average the data points in cluster 0:

# In[28]:

data[cluster_assignment==0].mean(axis=0)


# We are now ready to complete this function:

# In[29]:

def revise_centroids(data, k, cluster_assignment):
    new_centroids = []
    for i in xrange(k):
        # Select all data points that belong to cluster i. Fill in the blank (RHS only)
        member_data_points = data[cluster_assignment==i]
        # Compute the mean of the data points. Fill in the blank (RHS only)
        centroid = member_data_points.mean(axis=0)
        
        # Convert numpy.matrix type to numpy.ndarray type
        centroid = centroid.A1
        new_centroids.append(centroid)
    new_centroids = np.array(new_centroids)
    
    return new_centroids


# **Checkpoint**. Let's check our Step 2 implementation. Letting rows 0, 10, ..., 90 of `tf_idf` as the data points and the cluster labels `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1]`, we compute the next set of centroids. Each centroid is given by the average of all member data points in corresponding cluster.

# In[30]:

result = revise_centroids(tf_idf[0:100:10], 3, np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1]))
if np.allclose(result[0], np.mean(tf_idf[[0,30,40,60]].toarray(), axis=0)) and    np.allclose(result[1], np.mean(tf_idf[[10,20,90]].toarray(), axis=0))   and    np.allclose(result[2], np.mean(tf_idf[[50,70,80]].toarray(), axis=0)):
    print('Pass')
else:
    print('Check your code')


# ### Assessing convergence

# How can we tell if the k-means algorithm is converging? We can look at the cluster assignments and see if they stabilize over time. In fact, we'll be running the algorithm until the cluster assignments stop changing at all. To be extra safe, and to assess the clustering performance, we'll be looking at an additional criteria: the sum of all squared distances between data points and centroids. This is defined as
# $$
# J(\mathcal{Z},\mu) = \sum_{j=1}^k \sum_{i:z_i = j} \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mu_j\|^2.
# $$
# The smaller the distances, the more homogeneous the clusters are. In other words, we'd like to have "tight" clusters.

# **Quiz Question**. Let's step back from this particular example. If the clustering objective (heterogeneity) would ever increase when running k-means, that would indicate: (choose one)
# 
# 1. k-means algorithm got stuck in a bad local minimum
# 2. There is a bug in the k-means code
# 3. All data points consist of exact duplicates
# 4. Nothing is wrong. The objective should generally go down sooner or later.

# **Quiz Question**. Which of the cluster contains the greatest number of data points in the end? Hint: Use [`np.bincount()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.11.0/reference/generated/numpy.bincount.html) to count occurrences of each cluster label.

# ## Beware of local maxima

# One weakness of k-means is that it tends to get stuck in a local minimum. To see this, let us run k-means multiple times, with different initial centroids created using different random seeds.
# 
# **Note:** Again, in practice, you should set different seeds for every run. We give you a list of seeds for this assignment so that everyone gets the same answer.

# Notice the variation in heterogeneity for different initializations. This indicates that k-means sometimes gets stuck at a bad local minimum.

# **Quiz Question**. Another way to capture the effect of changing initialization is to look at the distribution of cluster assignments. Add a line to the code above to compute the size (# of member data points) of clusters for each run of k-means. Look at the size of the largest cluster (most # of member data points) across multiple runs, with seeds 0, 20000, ..., 120000. How much does this measure vary across the runs? What is the minimum and maximum values this quantity takes?

# One effective way to counter this tendency is to use **k-means++** to provide a smart initialization. This method tries to spread out the initial set of centroids so that they are not too close together. It is known to improve the quality of local optima and lower average runtime.

# ## How to choose K

# Since we are measuring the tightness of the clusters, a higher value of K reduces the possible heterogeneity metric by definition.  For example, if we have N data points and set K=N clusters, then we could have 0 cluster heterogeneity by setting the N centroids equal to the values of the N data points. (Note: Not all runs for larger K will result in lower heterogeneity than a single run with smaller K due to local optima.)  Let's explore this general trend for ourselves by performing the following analysis.

# Use the `kmeans_multiple_runs` function to run k-means with five different values of K.  For each K, use k-means++ and multiple runs to pick the best solution.  In what follows, we consider K=2,10,25,50,100 and 7 restarts for each setting.
# 
# **IMPORTANT: The code block below will take about one hour to finish. We highly suggest that you use the arrays that we have computed for you.**
# 
# Side note: In practice, a good implementation of k-means would utilize parallelism to run multiple runs of k-means at once. For an example, see [scikit-learn's KMeans](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html).

# In the above plot we show that heterogeneity goes down as we increase the number of clusters.

At the extreme, we can set individual data points to be their own clusters (K=N) and achieve zero heterogeneity, but separating each data point into its own cluster is hardly a desirable outcome. In the following section, we will learn how to detect a K set "too large".

# ## Visualize clusters of documents

# Let's start visualizing some clustering results to see if we think the clustering makes sense.  We can use such visualizations to help us assess whether we have set K too large or too small for a given application.  Following the theme of this course, we will judge whether the clustering makes sense in the context of document analysis.
# 
# What are we looking for in a good clustering of documents?
# * Documents in the same cluster should be similar.
# * Documents from different clusters should be less similar.
# 
# So a bad clustering exhibits either of two symptoms:
# * Documents in a cluster have mixed content.
# * Documents with similar content are divided up and put into different clusters.
# 
# To help visualize the clustering, we do the following:
# * Fetch nearest neighbors of each centroid from the set of documents assigned to that cluster. We will consider these documents as being representative of the cluster.
# * Print titles and first sentences of those nearest neighbors.
# * Print top 5 words that have highest tf-idf weights in each centroid.

# Indeed, increasing K achieved the desired effect of breaking up large clusters.  Depending on the application, this may or may not be preferable to the K=10 analysis.
# 
# Let's take it to the extreme and set K=100. We have a suspicion that this value is too large. Let us look at the top words from each cluster:

# In[82]:

k=100
visualize_document_clusters(wiki, tf_idf, centroids[k](), cluster_assignment[k](), k,
                            map_index_to_word, display_content=False)
# turn off text for brevity -- turn it on if you are curious ;)


# The class of soccer (association football) players has been broken into two clusters (44 and 45). Same goes for Austrialian rules football players (clusters 26 and 48). The class of baseball players have been also broken into two clusters (16 and 91).
# 
# **A high value of K encourages pure clusters, but we cannot keep increasing K. For large enough K, related documents end up going to different clusters.**
# 
# That said, the result for K=100 is not entirely bad. After all, it gives us separate clusters for such categories as Brazil, wrestling, computer science and the Mormon Church. If we set K somewhere between 25 and 100, we should be able to avoid breaking up clusters while discovering new ones.
# 
# Also, we should ask ourselves how much **granularity** we want in our clustering. If we wanted a rough sketch of Wikipedia, we don't want too detailed clusters. On the other hand, having many clusters can be valuable when we are zooming into a certain part of Wikipedia.
# 
# **There is no golden rule for choosing K. It all depends on the particular application and domain we are in.**
# 
# Another heuristic people use that does not rely on so much visualization, which can be hard in many applications (including here!) is as follows.  Track heterogeneity versus K and look for the "elbow" of the curve where the heterogeneity decrease rapidly before this value of K, but then only gradually for larger values of K.  This naturally trades off between trying to minimize heterogeneity, but reduce model complexity.  In the heterogeneity versus K plot made above, we did not yet really see a flattening out of the heterogeneity, which might indicate that indeed K=100 is "reasonable" and we only see real overfitting for larger values of K (which are even harder to visualize using the methods we attempted above.)

# **Quiz Question**. Another sign of too large K is having lots of small clusters. Look at the distribution of cluster sizes (by number of member data points). How many of the 100 clusters have fewer than 236 articles, i.e. 0.4% of the dataset?
# 
# Hint: Use `cluster_assignment[100]()`, with the extra pair of parentheses for delayed loading.

# In[108]:

bins = np.bincount(cluster_assignment[100]())
print len(bins[bins<236])


# ### Takeaway
# 
# Keep in mind though that tiny clusters aren't necessarily bad. A tiny cluster of documents that really look like each others is definitely preferable to a medium-sized cluster of documents with mixed content.
