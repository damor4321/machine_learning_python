# ## Implementing the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models

# In this section, you will implement the EM algorithm. We will take the following steps:
# 
# - Provide a log likelihood function for this model.
# - Implement the EM algorithm.
# - Create some synthetic data.
# - Visualize the progress of the parameters during the course of running EM.
# - Visualize the convergence of the model.

# ### Log likelihood 
# We provide a function to calculate log likelihood for mixture of Gaussians. The log likelihood quantifies the probability of observing a given set of data under a particular setting of the parameters in our model. We will use this to assess convergence of our EM algorithm; specifically, we will keep looping through EM update steps until the log likehood ceases to increase at a certain rate.

        ll += log_sum_exp(Z)
        
    return ll


# ### E-step: assign cluster responsibilities, given current parameters
# 
# The first step in the EM algorithm is to compute cluster responsibilities. Let $r_{ik}$ denote the responsibility of cluster $k$ for data point $i$. Note that cluster responsibilities are fractional parts: Cluster responsibilities for a single data point $i$ should sum to 1.
# $$
# r_{i1} + r_{i2} + \ldots + r_{iK} = 1
# $$
# 
# To figure how much a cluster is responsible for a given data point, we compute the likelihood of the data point under the  particular cluster assignment, multiplied by the weight of the cluster. For data point $i$ and cluster $k$, this quantity is
# $$
# r_{ik} \propto \pi_k N(x_i | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
# $$
# where $N(x_i | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)$ is the Gaussian distribution for cluster $k$ (with mean $\mu_k$ and covariance $\Sigma_k$).
# 
# We used $\propto$ because the quantity $N(x_i | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)$ is not yet the responsibility we want. To ensure that all responsibilities over each data point add up to 1, we add the normalization constant in the denominator:
# $$
# r_{ik} = \frac{\pi_k N(x_i | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k N(x_i | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}.
# $$
# 
# Complete the following function that computes $r_{ik}$ for all data points $i$ and clusters $k$.

# **Drawing from a Gaussian distribution.** SciPy provides a convenient function [multivariate_normal.pdf](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.multivariate_normal.html) that computes the likelihood of seeing a data point in a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The usage is

# ### M-step: Update parameters, given current cluster responsibilities

# Once the cluster responsibilities are computed, we update the parameters (weights, means, and covariances) associated with the clusters.
# 
# **Computing soft counts**. Before updating the parameters, we first compute what is known as "soft counts". The soft count of a cluster is the sum of all cluster responsibilities for that cluster:
# $$
# N^{\text{soft}}_k = r_{1k} + r_{2k} + \ldots + r_{Nk} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_{ik}
# $$
# 
# where we loop over data points. Note that, unlike k-means, we must loop over every single data point in the dataset. This is because all clusters are represented in all data points, to a varying degree.
# 
# We provide the function for computing the soft counts:

# In[6]:

def compute_soft_counts(resp):
    # Compute the total responsibility assigned to each cluster, which will be useful when 
    # implementing M-steps below. In the lectures this is called N^{soft}
    counts = np.sum(resp, axis=0)
    return counts


# **Updating weights.** The cluster weights show us how much each cluster is represented over all data points. The weight of cluster $k$ is given by the ratio of the soft count $N^{\text{soft}}_{k}$ to the total number of data points $N$:
# $$
# \hat{\pi}_k = \frac{N^{\text{soft}}_{k}}{N}
# $$
# Notice that $N$ is equal to the sum over the soft counts $N^{\text{soft}}_{k}$ of all clusters.
# 
# Complete the following function:

# In[7]:

    num_clusters = len(counts)

        # HINT: compute # of data points by summing soft counts.

# **Updating covariances**.  The covariance of each cluster is set to the weighted average of all [outer products](https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/LinearAlgebraReview.html), weighted by the cluster responsibilities:

# ## Fitting a Gaussian mixture model for image data
# 
# Now that we're confident in our implementation of the EM algorithm, we'll apply it to cluster some more interesting data. In particular, we have a set of images that come from four categories: sunsets, rivers, trees and forests, and cloudy skies. For each image we are given the average intensity of its red, green, and blue pixels, so we have a 3-dimensional representation of our data. Our goal is to find a good clustering of these images using our EM implementation; ideally our algorithm would find clusters that roughly correspond to the four image categories.
# 
# To begin with, we'll take a look at the data and get it in a form suitable for input to our algorithm. The data are provided in SFrame format:

# In[82]:

images = gl.SFrame('datasets/images.sf')
gl.canvas.set_target('ipynb')
import array
images['rgb'] = images.pack_columns(['red', 'green', 'blue'])['X4']
images.show()
images


# We need to come up with initial estimates for the mixture weights and component parameters. Let's take three images to be our initial cluster centers, and let's initialize the covariance matrix of each cluster to be diagonal with each element equal to the sample variance from the full data. As in our test on simulated data, we'll start by assuming each mixture component has equal weight. 
# 
# This may take a few minutes to run.

# In[39]:

np.random.seed(1)

# Initalize parameters
init_means = [images['rgb'][x] for x in np.random.choice(len(images), 4, replace=False)]
cov = np.diag([images['red'].var(), images['green'].var(), images['blue'].var()])
init_covariances = [cov, cov, cov, cov]
init_weights = [1/4., 1/4., 1/4., 1/4.]

# Convert rgb data to numpy arrays
img_data = [np.array(i) for i in images['rgb']]  


#DAF: understanding
print cov
print img_data[0:10]


# In[40]:

# Run our EM algorithm on the image data using the above initializations. 
# This should converge in about 125 iterations
out = EM(img_data, init_means, init_covariances, init_weights)


# The following sections will evaluate the results by asking the following questions:
# 
# * **Convergence**: How did the log likelihood change across iterations? Did the algorithm achieve convergence?
# * **Uncertainty**: How did cluster assignment and uncertainty evolve?
# * **Interpretability**: Can we view some example images from each cluster? Do these clusters correspond to known image categories?

# ### Evaluating convergence
# 
# Let's start by plotting the log likelihood at each iteration - we know that the EM algorithm guarantees that the log likelihood can only increase (or stay the same) after each iteration, so if our implementation is correct then we should see an increasing function.

# In[41]:

ll = out['loglik']
plt.plot(range(len(ll)),ll,linewidth=4)
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.ylabel('Log-likelihood')
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size':16})
plt.tight_layout()


# The log likelihood increases so quickly on the first few iterations that we can barely see the plotted line. Let's plot the log likelihood after the first three iterations to get a clearer view of what's going on:

# In[42]:

plt.figure()
plt.plot(range(3,len(ll)),ll[3:],linewidth=4)
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.ylabel('Log-likelihood')
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size':16})
plt.tight_layout()


# In[45]:

# DAF de la 100 en adelante para ver que sigue aumentando tambien en las ultimas
plt.figure()
plt.plot(range(100,len(ll)),ll[100:],linewidth=4)
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.ylabel('Log-likelihood')
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size':16})
plt.tight_layout()


# ### Evaluating uncertainty
# 
# Next we'll explore the evolution of cluster assignment and uncertainty. Remember that the EM algorithm represents uncertainty about the cluster assignment of each data point through the responsibility matrix. Rather than making a 'hard' assignment of each data point to a single cluster, the algorithm computes the responsibility of each cluster for each data point, where the responsibility corresponds to our certainty that the observation came from that cluster. 
# 
# We can track the evolution of the responsibilities across iterations to see how these 'soft' cluster assignments change as the algorithm fits the Gaussian mixture model to the data; one good way to do this is to plot the data and color each point according to its cluster responsibilities. Our data are three-dimensional, which can make visualization difficult, so to make things easier we will plot the data using only two dimensions, taking just the [R G], [G B] or [R B] values instead of the full [R G B] measurement for each observation.
# 

# In[46]:

import colorsys
def plot_responsibilities_in_RB(img, resp, title):
    N, K = resp.shape
    
    HSV_tuples = [(x*1.0/K, 0.5, 0.9) for x in range(K)]
    RGB_tuples = map(lambda x: colorsys.hsv_to_rgb(*x), HSV_tuples)
    
    R = img['red']
    B = img['blue']
    resp_by_img_int = [[resp[n][k] for k in range(K)] for n in range(N)]
    cols = [tuple(np.dot(resp_by_img_int[n], np.array(RGB_tuples))) for n in range(N)]

    plt.figure()
    for n in range(len(R)):
        plt.plot(R[n], B[n], 'o', c=cols[n])
    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel('R value')
    plt.ylabel('B value')
    plt.rcParams.update({'font.size':16})
    plt.tight_layout()


# To begin, we will visualize what happens when each data has random responsibilities.

# In[47]:

N, K = out['resp'].shape
random_resp = np.random.dirichlet(np.ones(K), N)
plot_responsibilities_in_RB(images, random_resp, 'Random responsibilities')


# We now use the above plotting function to visualize the responsibilites after 1 iteration. 

# In[48]:

out = EM(img_data, init_means, init_covariances, init_weights, maxiter=1)
plot_responsibilities_in_RB(images, out['resp'], 'After 1 iteration')


# We now use the above plotting function to visualize the responsibilites after 20 iterations. We will see there are fewer unique colors; this indicates that there is more certainty that each point belongs to one of the four components in the model. 

# In[49]:

out = EM(img_data, init_means, init_covariances, init_weights, maxiter=20)
plot_responsibilities_in_RB(images, out['resp'], 'After 20 iterations')


# Plotting the responsibilities over time in [R B] space shows a meaningful change in cluster assignments over the course of the algorithm's execution. While the clusters look significantly better organized at the end of the algorithm than they did at the start, it appears from our plot that they are still not very well separated. We note that this is due in part our decision to plot 3D data in a 2D space; everything that was separated along the G axis is now "squashed" down onto the flat [R B] plane. If we were to plot the data in full [R G B] space, then we would expect to see further separation of the final clusters.  We'll explore the cluster interpretability more in the next section.

# ### Interpreting each cluster

# Let's dig into the clusters obtained from our EM implementation. Recall that our goal in this section is to cluster images based on their RGB values. We can evaluate the quality of our clustering by taking a look at a few images that 'belong' to each cluster. We hope to find that the clusters discovered by our EM algorithm correspond to different image categories - in this case, we know that our images came from four categories ('cloudy sky', 'rivers', 'sunsets', and 'trees and forests'), so we would expect to find that each component of our fitted mixture model roughly corresponds to one of these categories.
# 
# If we want to examine some example images from each cluster, we first need to consider how we can determine cluster assignments of the images from our algorithm output. This was easy with k-means - every data point had a 'hard' assignment to a single cluster, and all we had to do was find the cluster center closest to the data point of interest. Here, our clusters are described by probability distributions (specifically, Gaussians) rather than single points, and our model maintains some uncertainty about the cluster assignment of each observation.
# 
# One way to phrase the question of cluster assignment for mixture models is as follows: how do we calculate the distance of a point from a distribution? Note that simple Euclidean distance might not be appropriate since (non-scaled) Euclidean distance doesn't take direction into account.  For example, if a Gaussian mixture component is very stretched in one direction but narrow in another, then a data point one unit away along the 'stretched' dimension has much higher probability (and so would be thought of as closer) than a data point one unit away along the 'narrow' dimension. 
# 
# In fact, the correct distance metric to use in this case is known as [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance). For a Gaussian distribution, this distance is proportional to the square root of the negative log likelihood. This makes sense intuitively - reducing the Mahalanobis distance of an observation from a cluster is equivalent to increasing that observation's probability according to the Gaussian that is used to represent the cluster. This also means that we can find the cluster assignment of an observation by taking the Gaussian component for which that observation scores highest. We'll use this fact to find the top examples that are 'closest' to each cluster.
# 
# __Quiz Question:__ Calculate the likelihood (score) of the first image in our data set (`images[0]`) under each Gaussian component through a call to `multivariate_normal.pdf`.  Given these values, what cluster assignment should we make for this image? Hint: don't forget to use the cluster weights.

# In[54]:

K = len(out['means'])
p = np.zeros(K)
for k in range(K):
    p[k] = out['weights'][k]*multivariate_normal.pdf(images[0]['rgb'], mean=out['means'][k], cov=out['covs'][k])

print out['weights']
print p
print np.argmax(p)


# Now we calculate cluster assignments for the entire image dataset using the result of running EM for 20 iterations above:

# In[96]:

weights = out['weights']
means = out['means']
covariances = out['covs']
rgb = images['rgb']
N = len(images) # number of images
K = len(means) # number of clusters

assignments = [0]*N
probs = [0]*N

for i in range(N):
    # Compute the score of data point i under each Gaussian component:
    p = np.zeros(K)
    for k in range(K):
        p[k] = weights[k]*multivariate_normal.pdf(rgb[i], mean=means[k], cov=covariances[k])
        
    # Compute assignments of each data point to a given cluster based on the above scores:
    assignments[i] = np.argmax(p)
    
    # For data point i, store the corresponding score under this cluster assignment:
    probs[i] = np.max(p)

#assignments = gl.SFrame({'assignments':assignments, 'probs':probs, 'image':images['image'], 'folder':images['folder'] })
assignments = gl.SFrame({'assignments':assignments, 'probs':probs, 'image':images['path'], })

#assignments = gl.SFrame({'assignments':assignments, 'probs':probs, 'image':images})


# We'll use the 'assignments' SFrame to find the top images from each cluster by sorting the datapoints within each cluster by their score under that cluster (stored in `probs`). We can plot the corresponding images in the original data using show().
# 
# Create a function that returns the top 5 images assigned to a given category in our data (HINT: use the GraphLab Create function `topk(column, k)` to find the k top values according to specified column in an SFrame).

# In[97]:

print images
print assignments[assignments['assignments'] == 1]


# In[114]:

def get_top_images(assignments, cluster, k=5):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    images_in_cluster = assignments[assignments['assignments'] == cluster]
    top_images = images_in_cluster.topk('probs', k)
    return top_images


# Use this function to show the top 5 images in each cluster.

# In[117]:

gl.canvas.set_target('ipynb')
for component_id in range(4):
    res = get_top_images(assignments, component_id)
    get_top_images(assignments, component_id).show()
    print res
    print res['image']


# These look pretty good! Our algorithm seems to have done a good job overall at 'discovering' the four categories that from which our image data was drawn. It seems to have had the most difficulty in distinguishing between rivers and cloudy skies, probably due to the similar color profiles of images in these categories; if we wanted to achieve better performance on distinguishing between these categories, we might need a richer representation of our data than simply the average [R G B] values for each image.
